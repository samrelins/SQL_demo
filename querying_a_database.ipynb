Each row is matched with corresponding rows from the \"RIGHT\" table if available, otherwise the columns from the \"RIGHT\" table are recorded as NULL if no matching entries are available. In our movies / ratings example, this would be return all the movies, with ratings info if available and NULL values for the ratings otherwise.\n",
    "* `CROSS JOIN`: this join doesn't require a join condition, and combines the \"n\" entries of the LEFT table with the \"m\" entries of the RIGHT table to form an \"n x m\" table. There isn't a good use-case for this join type with the movies database. More generally you might, for example, use a `CROSS JOIN` if you had a table of \"products\" and another table of \"stores\" and wanted a table with each unique combination of \"products\" and \"stores\" to record individual sales.
