As an example, take the `ratings` data - asking for all 26M entries will take a considerable time to load and will likely consume a large portion (if not all) of our local memory.

We'll also start to face issues with the complexity of our queries - stitching table after table together to form one gigantic table, and then having SQL calculate table constraints on this giant table is not very efficient.

More importantly, in joining all these tables we would create a **huge** table - each of the 26M reviews would be replicated **per genre** of each movie - before we grouped the results together, which would be horribly inneficient. Instead, we can split our query into two: we can first join all the movies with their ratings, and then use a `WITH` command to join these results with a list of the genres (like we created above). Let's start by writing a command to return all the movie titles, along with their average rating and number of ratings:"
