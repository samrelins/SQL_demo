    "In this notebook we will walk step-by-step through the process of designing a relational database. We have already discussed the power of relational databases to easily store huge amounts of data and quickly retrieve query results. The key to this power is the database \"schema\" or structure. Decisions taken during the design process can have huge downstream impacts on the effectiveness of your storage solution, and so the importance of setting off on the right track cannot be overstated! \n",
    "\n",
    "# The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very high level, a relational database is simply a collection of tables. Each table is usually thought of as representing an individual \"entity type\", like a customer or store. These tables contain rows and columns, much like those of a spreadsheet, that store all the data for that \"entity\". The columns are the features of the data (i.e. names, ages, shoe sizes, favourite cheeses etc.) and the rows individual examples, each with a unique key. For example, a customer table may look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID    | name    | favourite_cheese |\n",
    "| :---- | ------- | ---------------: |\n",
    "| 1     | John    | emmental         |\n",
    "| 2     | Emma    | Cheddar          |\n",
    "| 3     | Brandy  | Gorgonzola       |\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of a table is referred to as its \"schema\". This is some basic information that defines the columns that make up each table, what goes in each column and the rules that apply to that column. Using the above as an example, a simple schema might say:\n",
    "\n",
    "    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, \n",
    "    name TEXT NOT NULL, \n",
    "    favourite_cheese TEXT DEFAULT NULL \n",
    "    \n",
    "although you may be able to parse the meaning of some of these terms, the specifics of this language aren't too important at the moment; just note that the schema defines the content of each column of the table and the rules that apply to them. The magic of relational databases is that, with this pre-defined schema spelling out exactly what to expect in each column of a table, the data can be very efficiently stored and queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language used above to define the database schema is an example of Structured Query Language or SQL (pronounced sequel). SQL is the most popular language used to give instructsion to relational database engines, several of which are named after SQL i.e. SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL. As we walk through the process of creating a database, all of the database commands will be written in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Task\n",
    "\n",
    "As a model example, we will tackle the very real problem of taking a large dataset and designing a database schema to effectively store it. We will be using The Movies Dataset - a group of files containing information from the GROUPLENS MOVIELENS PROJECT, which has been helpfully assembled in THIS KAGGLE DATASET. To save some time cleaning up the raw data and keeping focus on the task at hand, a few adjustments have been made to the raw dataset as it's found on Kaggle, prior to this notebook. Should anybody be interested in this preprocessing, it can be found in THIS PRE-PROCESSING NOTEBOOK.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The (pre-processed) dataset consists of 3 CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `movies.csv`: basic metadata for 44k+ movies - title, runtime, budget, original language etc.\n",
    "* `ratings.csv`: 29 million + user reviews consisting of a simple 0.5 to 5 rating in increments of 0.5 \n",
    "* `credits.csv`: The full casting credits of each movie, including the actor, charachter name, order of appearance etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll walk through the different files one-by-one and build our database as we go, introducing different principles and concepts as the are required. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build our database, we'll be using SQLite3 - a hugely popular and super simple database engine that has a fully-fledged python module provided right out of the box. We'll also be using the pandas data-analysis library to load and manipulate data. Whilst it is certainly worthwhile familiarising yourself with both, don't be to concerned if you don't have any experience with either - the real focus of this task is the SQL commands used to create the database. Each SQL database engine differs slightly in features and syntax, but the commands used in this notebook should be pretty universal. Every effort has been made to provide informative comments for all of the pandas script, so it should hopefully be easy to follow.\n",

    "First off, we'll take a look at the movies data:"

    "With the genres set aside, we now wish to store all of our movies data in a database table. This leads us to consider some basic concepts of database design: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we need to consider the type of data we are storing in each column, as this has to be specified as part of the database schema. Each different SQL database engine offers a different range of datatypes, so your decisions here may differ depending on the tools available to you. SQLite3 offers the following 5 basic datatypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NULL** - just your run of the mill null\n",
    "* **INTEGER** - a signed (+/-) integer in 1-8 bytes depending on its size\n",
    "* **REAL** - an 8 byte floating point number\n",
    "* **TEXT** - a text string\n",
    "* **BLOB** - everything else! A \"blob\" of data stored exactly as it comes\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of our features should fit nicely with these datatypes. This may seem a little restrictive, however, when it comes to other data i.e. it's not clear how to store the `release_date` feature. Dont worry! SQLite offers compatibility with a huge range of datatype names that don't appear above, and \"coerces\" the data into the correct type as it's inserted. For example, dates can be input as **DATE** or **DATETIME** and SQLite will know what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We should also consider some basic rules, or \"constraints\" as they are called in SQL. A good example is defining a **PRIMARY KEY** - every table needs one\\*. A primary key is a unique identifier for each entry in your table, and helps facilitate queries and manipulations of your database during use. In the case of our movies data, this should clearly apply to the `ID` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* *whilst historically this is accurate, it's not actually the case with SQLite3 or other modern SQL variants, but to keep things simple its easier to assume this requirement.*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are literally hundreds of possible constraints that can be applied to columns or the whole table. Other common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NOT NULL** - specifies that Null values are not permitted in the column in question\n",
    "* **UNIQUE** - enforces the rule that each item in the column is unique (no repeats)\n",
    "* **DEFAULT** - assignes as default value to the column if one isn't provided\n",
    "\n",
    "We could stay here for days listing the variants of schema design, but it's generally easiser to guide discussion with an example. With that in mind, lets get stuck in and define our movies table:"

    "\n",
    "### Composite Primary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue we face is defining a PRIMARY KEY. There isn't a single unique feature of the ratings data, like that of the `id` column in the movies table. A bit of data exploration will show that each user can submit only one rating per movie, so the **combination** of `user_id` and `movie_id` is unique. SQLite allows us to leverage this and define a composite primary key - that is, a PRIMARY KEY composed of two or more columns of our table (generally speaking, more than two is not sensible). When composing our INSERT command we define a composite PRIMARY KEY as a table constraint rather than a column constraint - we'll see an example of this in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    ". We do this by specifying a FOREIGN KEY: a column constraint telling our database that one of the columns in our table relates to a column in another table. In the case of the ratings data, each rating \"belongs\" to a specific movie. Therefore, the `movie_id` column of the ratings data corresponds with the `id` column of the movies table. This is what's called a \"one to many\" relationship: one movie can be related to many ratings, but each rating belongs to only one movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys allow us to define rules about changing or deleting data in our database. This prevents us from \"orphaning\" entries in one table by deleting or changing related \"parent\" entries in another table; think of the reviews for \"Toy Story\" if we were to delete the coresponding movie or change its id - they would no longer \"belong\" to an existing movie, and so would be rating nothing! Insted we can tell our database what to do when a movie is changed or deleted. For example, we can tell the database to delete / update all corresponding ratings as their \"parent\" movie is deleted / updated, or simply prevent any changes to movies that have corresponding ratings.  \n",

We also define a `FOREIGN KEY` table constraint on the `movie_id` column, specifying that this `REFERENCES` the `id` column in the `movies` table. Using this key, we tell our database that `ON` attempting to `DELETE` a \"parent\" movie entry, the database should `RESTRICT` this request and return an error. Similarly, we state that `ON UPDATE`ing a \"parent\" movie entry the changes should `CASCADE` through any relevant ratings - put simply, if the movie id is changed this should be updated on any corresponding ratings.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of interesting points to note at this stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we don't need to specify that a PRIMARY KEY should be NOT NULL - SQLite enforces this for us\n",
    "\n",
    "2. we've stored two very different forms of DATE in our database.

SQLite has datetime functions capable of parsing both these formats, meaning we can stick them both in our database without worrying about any issues when we come to query them.  \n",

    "Important Note: The `appearance_order` column was originally labeled `order` in the dataframe above. The name was chaged when creating the credits table, as SQLite has an `ORDER` function and reserves all function names to prevent any namespace clashes. Be mindful of this when chosing your column / table names as SQLite will return an error if there's a clash.\n",

In the process, we've carefully considered the features of our data and how to organise them to best suit the features of a relational database. To recap, here are a few key considerations when creating a database:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Splitting Up Data:** What does your data contain? Decide how your data divides into individual entities i.e. information that relates to the same concept and does not repeat unnecesarily. Create tables according to these entities. \n",
    "2. **Primary Keys:** What is the unique identifying feature of each entry? Select or define a unique feature or combination of features that can be used to identify each entry in your table\n",
    "3. **Constraints:** What rules should be followed when adding entries? Choose appropriate column / table constraints to ensure the data in your tables is of the correct format and has the right features.\n",
    "4. **Table relationships:** How do your entities / tables relate to one another? Carefully define one-to-many and many-to-many relations, create any required junction tables, and apply any foreign key constraints to ensure your database is managed properly \n",
    "\n",
    "And that about does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick postscript:\n",
    "\n",
    "The above notebook has been structured around the historic basic principles of relational databases. Many modern SQL database engines, such as Oracle or Google BigQuery, offer users the option to \"nest\" data or repeat entries in a list-like format, like the genre and credits data we saw above. Such features would have a `STRUCT` or `RECORD` datatype. If you have these advanced datatypes at your disposal, your design decisions may be very different when building your database. Indeed, these features in their original format could have been stored in their original format using these more advanced datatypes, and were probably taken directly from a database with a schema built using these features!"
